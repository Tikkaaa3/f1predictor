XGBoost:
Advantages of XGboost

    Scalable and efficient for large datasets with millions of records
    Supports parallel processing and GPU acceleration for faster training
    Offers customizable parameters and regularization for fine-tuning
    Includes feature importance analysis for better insights and selection
    Trusted by data scientists across multiple programming languages

Disadvantages of XGBoost

    XGBoost can be computationally intensive, making it less ideal for resource-constrained systems.
    It may be sensitive to noise or outliers, requiring careful data preprocessing.
    Prone to overfitting, especially on small datasets or with too many trees.
    Offers feature importance, but overall model interpretability is limited compared to simpler methods which is an issue in fields like healthcare or finance.
